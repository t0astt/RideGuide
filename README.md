# About
This repository contains my 1st place app submission to the 2015 Illinois State University/State Farm MAD (Mobile Application Development) contest.

The app is called "RideGuide" and is a ridesharing app made specifically for university students... before Uber and Lyft took off and became mainstream.

More on the contest can be found here: [https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2015/04/2015-mad-contest-winners-announced/](https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2015/04/2015-mad-contest-winners-announced/).
